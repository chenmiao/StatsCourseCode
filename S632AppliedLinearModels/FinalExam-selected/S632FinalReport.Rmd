Q1. Explain what the syntax_final.R does and apply it to the data inter_assess.tx. 

The R script first generates a random number from uniform distribution[n/100,n/10] where n is the number of rows in the original data set and n=14,657 here, and that is to say, it first generates a number from uniform distribution [146.57, 1465.7]. The random number is then rounded to an integer. the number I obtained is 497 based on my seed setup. Then randomly sample 497 cases from the original data and use this as the working data set for the final project.

Q2. 

The data contains 294 complete cases, out of the total 497 cases.
